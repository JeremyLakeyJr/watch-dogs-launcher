# Project: Watch Dogs 2 Themed Android Launcher

## Overview

This project aims to develop a feature-rich, highly customizable Android launcher that immerses the user in the world of Watch Dogs 2. The user interface and experience will be meticulously crafted to replicate the "hacktivist" aesthetic of the game, featuring elements like glitch art, ASCII art, terminal-like interfaces, and a color palette inspired by the game.

## Core Features

*   **Themed Home Screen:** A dynamic home screen that replaces the standard app grid with a more immersive, "hacker-space" environment.
*   **Customizable Widgets:** Widgets for weather, system stats (CPU, RAM, battery), and news feeds, all styled to match the Watch Dogs 2 theme.
*   **App Drawer:** A unique app drawer that can be accessed through a "hack" animation or a hidden command.
*   **Live Wallpaper:** An animated background that simulates the data streams and network activity seen in the game.
*   **Sound Effects:** Custom sound effects for UI interactions that match the game's audio cues.
*   **Icon Pack Support:** While providing a default set of themed icons, the launcher will also support third-party icon packs.

## Advanced Features

*   **Gesture Controls:** Customizable gestures to launch apps, trigger actions, or open the app drawer.
*   **Terminal Integration:** A built-in terminal for advanced users to execute shell commands.
*   **Scripting Support:** Allow users to write simple scripts to automate tasks within the launcher.
*   **Theming Engine:** A powerful theming engine that allows users to customize colors, fonts, and animations.

## Design Philosophy

The design will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Immersion:** Every element of the launcher should contribute to the feeling of being a DedSec hacker.
*   **Functionality:** While prioritizing aesthetics, the launcher must remain a fast, efficient, and practical tool for daily use.
*   **Customization:** Users should have a high degree of control over the look and feel of their home screen.
