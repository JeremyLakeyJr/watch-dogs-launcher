# Watch Dogs Launcher

## A Hyper-Customizable, Hacker-Themed Android Launcher

This project transforms your standard Android experience into a "DedSec-style" hacker interface, inspired by the world of Watch Dogs 2. It's built for users who crave a unique, tech-centric, and highly functional home screen.

## Core Features

*   **Dynamic Theming Engine:** The entire UI is built on a dynamic Material 3 theme. You can change the core color palette on the fly from the settings menu.
*   **Terminal App Launcher:** Forget scrolling through app drawers. Hit the "Terminal" button to summon a command-line interface. Start typing an app's name to instantly find and launch it.
*   **System Stats Widget:** Keep an eye on your device's vital signs with a home screen widget that displays real-time RAM and battery levels.
*   **Animated UI:** The UI is designed to be fluid and responsive, with smooth animations for opening and closing the app drawer, settings, and terminal.

## Advanced Features (Roadmap)

*   **Advanced Terminal Commands:** The terminal will be expanded to support commands like `uninstall <app_name>`, `info <app_name>`, and even running shell commands.
*   **Customizable Home Screen Grid:** Full control over the home screen grid, including adding, removing, and repositioning app icons and widgets.
*   **Themed Icon Pack Support:** While providing a default set of themed icons, the launcher will also support third-party icon packs.
*   **Live Wallpaper:** An interactive, animated background that simulates data streams, network activity, and other hacker-themed visuals.
*   **Sound Effects:** Custom sound effects for UI interactions that match the game's audio cues.

## How to Use

*   **Set as Default Launcher:** After installing, press the home button and select "Watch Dogs Launcher" as your default.
*   **Accessing Features:**
    *   **Apps:** Tap the "Apps" button to open the app drawer.
    *   **Settings:** Tap the "Settings" button to customize the theme.
    *   **Terminal:** Tap the "Terminal" button to open the command-line app launcher.

## Design Philosophy

*   **Immersion:** Every element of the launcher should contribute to the feeling of being a DedSec hacker.
*   **Functionality:** While prioritizing aesthetics, the launcher must remain a fast, efficient, and practical tool for daily use.
*   **Customization:** Users should have a high degree of control over the look and feel of their home screen.
