About The Project

Welcome to the DedSec Launcher, a feature-rich, highly customizable Android launcher that immerses you in the world of Watch Dogs 2. This project was born from a love for the game's unique "hacktivist" aesthetic. The user interface and experience are meticulously crafted to replicate that vibe, featuring elements like glitch art, ASCII art, terminal-like interfaces, and a color palette inspired by the game.

Our philosophy is to balance immersion with functionality. While we want you to feel like a member of DedSec, the launcher must also be a fast, efficient, and practical tool for your daily life.
